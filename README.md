# The-Recruitment-Revolution---Website-Development
Recruiting 2.0 seeks to serve as a guide to the ever evolving world of Artificial Intelligence and its use in the field of recruitment

A  prototype mobile app made with Figma that is a community shopping application which offers free delivery on all grocery or item orders made within a specific locations' radius. The purpose of this application is to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by promoting members of the same community to buy items for each other.

When a member offers to deliver another member's order for them we call them a `Helper`. These Helpers can deliver up to `4` community members order while doing their personal shopping, hence reducing the number of people physically grocery shopping in stores.
