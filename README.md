# The Recruitment Revolution - Website Development
Recruiting 2.0 seeks to serve as a guide to the ever evolving world of Artificial Intelligence and its use in the field of recruitment

What is AI?: Technology that allows machines to learn from experience in order to make decisions similar to the human mind.

Our mission is educate individuals and organisations, specifically employers on the use of AI as tool for recruiting and the value that ethics holds on this topic. One of the most important factors to consider for AI algorithm training is human bias, specifically regarding gender and race. As AI systems need plenty of data to train with accuracy, the datasets are chosen by humans first-hand.

In this process, the existing biases may be transferred to AI systems when they develop themselves for the future.
If AI systems were to develop the ability to feel in the future, will they generate their own biases? Therefore, it is important to train algorithms without human biases.

### Home Page
The home page conatins 2 call to action buttons that define Artificial Intelligence and offer recruiters a checklist to use when reviewing their ethical practices regarding the use of AI. I designed the home page to be used for excellent branding for my team's project by displaying our logo, slogan and used motion effects for a smooth transition into other sections on the home page. The home page is also repsonsive on  mobile, tablet and desktop versions by adpting itself and removing or adding elements depending on the screen size.
